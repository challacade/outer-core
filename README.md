# Outer Core
Outer Core is an open-source game created using Love2D. It was made for GMTK Game Jam 2022, which had the theme of 'Roll of the Dice'. A build for this game is available on itch.io at this URL:
https://kyleschaub.itch.io/outer-core

To combat an alien invasion, your team of attack robots are equipped with various weapons. However, each bot is powered by a dice-like core which determines which attacks it may use, making its behavior a roll of the dice. Strategize the risk-vs-reward of your bot's equipped core, their position, and various upgrades to help get past each wave of incoming aliens!

This game can be run locally the same as any other Love2D project. Follow my YouTube tutorial for more info on this process:
